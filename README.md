<h1 align="center">Tezac NFT Marketplace</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A privacy-preserving NFT marketplace protocol built on the Aztec Network. It enables private NFT ownership, hidden reserve prices, blind auctions, cross-chain bridging, front-running resistance, and provably fair NFT-based games, all with ZK proofs.</strong>
</p>

---

## Overview

Tezac leverages Aztecâ€™s zkRollup architecture to encrypt NFT ownership data and transactions, ensuring on-chain privacy for trading, auctions, and gaming applications. By bridging established NFT collections from L1 (e.g., Ethereum), Tezac combines the liquidity of major ecosystems with the privacy benefits of zero-knowledge proofs.

## Features

1. **Private NFT Ownership and Trading**  
   Ownership records are encrypted, and all trades occur using private notes, obscuring user identities and transaction details.

2. **Hidden Reserve Prices and Blind Auctions**  
   Sellers can set hidden reserve prices, while buyers participate in sealed-bid auctions without revealing their bids on-chain until settlement.

3. **Cross-Chain NFT Trading**  
   Integrates with existing L1 NFT collections through a bridge system, enabling private trading of established NFTs.

4. **Provably Fair NFT Games**  
   Verifiable randomness ensures fair raffles, lotteries, or mystery box reveals without exposing participant identities or sensitive state.

5. **Front-Running Resistance**  
   Time-locked or encrypted order submissions prevent miners or bots from exploiting transaction details in the mempool.

## Roadmap

0. Create Private NFT Contracts (WIP)
1. Creating Private Listings & Purchasing (WIP)
